**RISC-V Steel** is a free and open 32-bit RISC-V processor core for digital designs. It is developed so that you can take advantage of the free RISC-V ISA in new hardware projects, from small embedded designs to complex systems on a chip.

**[Check out the Getting Started guide!](https://rafaelcalcada.github.io/steel-core/getting-started/)**

### Key features

- [x] `RV32I` + `Zicsr` + `Machine-level ISA` <br/>
- [x] 3-stage pipeline, in-order execution <br/>
- [x] Passes all [RISC-V Compatibility Test Framework v2.0](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test) tests <br/>
- [x] Production-ready <br/>
- [x] Single [source file](riscv_steel_core.v) written in human-readable Verilog <br/>
- [x] Free and open-source ([MIT License](LICENSE.md))

### Documentation

The project has gone through significant changes recently, making the old docs obsolete. **New docs will be available soon.**

### History

Steel Core was developed for the author's final year college project in 2020. The project goal was to help expand the adoption of the RISC-V architecture by creating a RISC-V core with the basic features to run embedded software that is simple to reuse.
