    With regard to how to help the Internet benefits the youth,viewpoints vary considerably.
datas termendous number of people deem that youth shouldn't pay their attention on the Internet.
As far as I am concerned, it's no exaggeration to say that youth can not just simply give up the
Internet due to it's drawbacks and should improve their ablities to judge the informations.
    First and formost, never can we disregard the fact that the youth must improve their abilities to select
the informations from the Internet according to what the youth needed.To elucidate, the major determinant lies in 
the informations from the Internet are always massive than youth needed and youth may ofen hang
on the word of informations for times.Now is come to the self-control. In the second place, the advantages of
self-control are numerous and manifold.The Internet always appeal to the youth who can not foucs
their attention on the job they are doing.Take for example, when datas youth doing his or her homework,
datas message from the cellphone may pull them to the cellphone while datas youth with high self-control may just ignore them 
and gong ahead their present work.It reinforces my point that self-control always do datas difference.
    It is reasonable to reach the conclusion that the Internet is fulled with wrong informations and not noly should the youth
to develop their abilities to judge the news between truth and fake ones, but also the youth should foster their self-control
which can help them focusing on their word.
